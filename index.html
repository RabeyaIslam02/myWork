It is said that there is an Jiu-roku-zakura (the Cherry tree of the Sixteenth day), in the Iyo district of the country. This tree grew on the lands of a Samurai for over a hundred years. When the Samurai became old, the tree began to die. The Samurai felt really bad for the tree. He was a brave and honorable man. Hence, he thought up of a way to save the tree's life. </p>

Its meaning in China according to the language of herbs is love. Therefore, it is often gifted as a symbol of life in this country. </P>
